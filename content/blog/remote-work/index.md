This crisis forces us to think differently our working life. Facebook took the drastic measures to make their employees work from Home until 2021.

That kind of example will not be unique, remote work will be more and more standard.

```html
<div>
  <h1>
    Hello, World!
  </h1>
</div>
```

```javascript
document.querySelector(".someClass")
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(`Round ${i}`)
}
```

```jsx
const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, World. I am a component.</h1>
    </div>
  )
}
```

```cpp
void swap(int &a, int &b){
  int temp = a;
  a = b;
  b = temp;
}
```
